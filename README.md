### Code Introduction
---
The parent Folder for my work is ```TRAIN-UP-A-CHILD-PAGE``` <br>
which is stored in the general Project Folder <br>


The website contains two pages:


> HOME PAGE and ABOUT US page
 
 and such the code is divided into two files: 

 ```index.html``` and ```about-us.html``` files

 Each file has its own separate file for styling:

 ```style.css``` and a```about-us.css``` files <br>
 which are contained in the CSS Folder
 ----
The ```Home page``` is the main page of the website.<br>
```About Us``` page speaks about what the organization handles.<br>
With the "Go to top of page", one can go to the top of the current page

----
#### The Code Flow

The two files are linked to each other.<br>
This means you can jump from one file to another file from any page.

Using the <nav></nav> element,the ```Home page``` and ```About us ``` menu are created.
